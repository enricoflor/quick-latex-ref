#+title: Quick LaTeX Ref
#+author: Enrico Flor

While writing in LaTeX, you often want to reference (through the ~\ref~
macro) things just above or just below point.  Some LaTeX packages
offer special macros that are always expanded in this sense (for
example, a macro ~\Next~ that expands into a ~\ref{LABEL}~ if the first
label macro after ~\Next~ is ~\label{LABEL}~).

However, this is somewhat of an antipattern: it is a convenient
feature (because so often you want to refer to something close to
point), but it can cause serious headaches if you happen to
restructure the text where these references occur.  It may be very
hard to notice that the reference you intended is now different
because a different ~\label~ than the one you intended to refer to
intervenes between the ~\Next~ macro and the item it should refer to.
The convenience provided by these macros is better delivered by your
text editor (ideally, GNU Emacs).

This functionality is what this package provides.
There are three entry points (three interactive commands):

+ ~quick-latex-ref~
+ ~quick-latex-ref-previous~
+ ~quick-latex-ref-next~

If you want to refer to the first ~\label~ following point, call
~quick-late-ref-next~: the appropriate ~\ref~ macro will be inserted.  The
opposite effect of course is obtained by ~quick-latex-ref-previous~.
Note that these commands will retrieve the closest ~\label~ even if that
occurs in a hidden section (e.g. folded by ~outline-mode~) or outside
the narrowed portion of the buffer.

Once you call any of these commands you actually enter a loop, whereby
you can "walk" up and down the ~\label~ macros in the buffer through the
characters you can set as the values of these two variables:

+ ~quick-latex-ref-previous-key~ (~p~ by default)
+ ~quick-latex-ref-next-key~ (~n~ by default).

If you want to use ~k~ and ~j~ instead, for example, add this to your
configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq quick-latex-ref-previous-key ?k
      quick-latex-ref-next-key ?j)
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: quick-latex-ref in action
#+NAME:   fig:quick-latex-ref-demo
[[./quick-latex-ref-demo.gif]]

All three of these commands can be called with the prefix argument, in
which case only the label itself (i.e., the argument of the ~\label~
macro) is inserted at point.  Furthermore, if the variable
~quick-latex-ref-only-label-if-in-argument~ is set to ~t~ (as it is by
default), only the label (and not a full ~\ref~ macro) is inserted if
point is already inside the braces that determine the argument of a
~\ref~ macro.

As you can see in the gif, ~\label~ macros that are in comments are
completely ignored.  If the variable ~quick-latex-ref-show-context~ is ~t~
(as per default), the context of the current ~\label~ candidate is shown
in the echo area, to help you determine whether that is indeed the
label you are interested in.  The context is the three lines (visual
lines, if you are in ~visual-line-mode~) where the candidate ~\label~ is
in.

The faces that highlight the expression at point (either the label or
the whole ~\ref~ macro) and the current target ~\label~ macro are defined
as the values of ~quick-latex-ref-at-point~ and
~quick-latex-current-target~ respectively.  By default, they are the
same face with which the current theme treats the active region.

There is a third action you can take while being in the loop, through
the character specified as the value of ~quick-latex-ref-goto-key~ (~.~ by
default).  This action will do the following things:

+ move point to the buffer position corresponding to the currently
  selected label;
+ exit the loop;
+ undo any insertion that was done after entering the loop you just
  exited.

Remember that whenever the loop is entered with any of the three above
interactive commands, the position of point is pushed to the mark
ring, so that you can easily return to that point after exiting the
loop somewhere else in the buffer.
